        <li>⅔ cup milk        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter        </li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil        </li>
        <li>1 large egg        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons gluten-free all-purpose flour, or as needed        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon        </li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, melted        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened        </li>
        <li>¾ cup powdered sugar        </li>
        <li>½ tablespoon lemon juice        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract        </li>
        <li>1 dash salt        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Combine sugar and yeast in a small bowl. Mix flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Place milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high, stirring every 15 seconds, until 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 46 degrees C), about 45 seconds. Whisk into yeast mixture and set aside to proof, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine proofed yeast with olive oil, egg, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; mix for a few seconds, then slowly add flour mixture. Mix with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until dough thickens and loses some of its stickiness, about 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover a work surface with plastic wrap and a light layer of flour. Place dough in the center, dust with a little more flour, and cover with another sheet of plastic wrap. Roll out to a 10x13-inch rectangle; remove the top layer of plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Make filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread melted butter over dough; sprinkle brown sugar mixture evenly over top.</li>
        <li>Starting at a long edge, roll dough up like a jelly roll, using the plastic wrap to help lift and roll as you go. Lightly sprinkle dough with more flour and cut into 10 pieces with a sharp knife. Place rolls in a greased baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a warm spot to rise for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 22 to 27 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make frosting: Beat butter and cream cheese in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add powdered sugar; mix until smooth. Mix in lemon juice, vanilla extract, and salt.</li>
        <li>Remove cinnamon rolls from the oven and immediately drizzle frosting over top.</li>
