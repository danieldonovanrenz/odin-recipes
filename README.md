This project is all about testing and showcasing my new HTML skills from the HTML portion of the Odin Foundations Course. I'll do that by creating a very simple (unstyled) recipes website. It'll have a home page with links to 3 recipes. The subtle irony here is that I don't cook. In real life, my recipe following extends no further than "put in toaster". Jk, but that's close to the truth... 

Specifically, this will showcase that I have the following skills: 
- I can set up HTML pages with all the requisite boilerplate
- I can make headings & paragraphs
- I can insert images and links, with appropriate attributes
- I can insert lists, ordered and unordered
- [TBD - fill in at end of project]

Cheers.
